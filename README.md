### Angular Flex: building with style
The presentation/workshow focused on teaching attendees about the principles of good design and how they can be applied to user interfaces. The presentation covered the concept of design as an acceptable solution to a set of problems and emphasized its importance as a living and evolving entity. Attendees learned about the balance between design constraints such as space, usability, aesthetics, and effort, as well as the role of iteration and feedback in the design process. The presentation also included a live build of UIs using Angular Flex, allowing attendees to see the abstract concepts put into practical use.
